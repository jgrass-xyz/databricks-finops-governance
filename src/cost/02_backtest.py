# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Notebook Summary:** Validates the monitor's logic against actual history. Replays the last N days of billing data hour-by-hour as if the monitor had been running in real time, then reports catch rate and lead-time distribution against known-bad cluster-days. Use this to tune thresholds (`budget_daily_dollars`, `z_warning`, `z_critical`) *before* going live.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Replay `system.billing.usage` at hourly granularity to answer:
# MAGIC **"For each cluster-day that actually cost more than the budget, at what hour would the monitor have fired?"**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Uses a rolling daily baseline (each simulated day is scored against stats built only from days *before* it, so results reflect what the monitor would have known in real time).
# MAGIC Writes per-cluster-day outcomes to `backtest_results` for ad-hoc analysis (catch rate, lead-time distribution, missed spend) — query the table directly however suits the engagement.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Parameters
# MAGIC
# MAGIC | Widget | Default | What it controls |
# MAGIC |---|---|---|
# MAGIC | `catalog` | `main` | UC catalog where results land. Must match `00_baseline_refresh`. |
# MAGIC | `schema` | `finops_observability` | UC schema under `catalog`. Must match `00_baseline_refresh`. |
# MAGIC | `budget_daily_dollars` | `5000` | Same semantics as in `01_monitor`. Also defines the ground-truth "bad cluster-day" — any cluster-day that actually cost above this is what we're trying to have caught. |
# MAGIC | `z_warning` | `2.0` | Z-score threshold applied during simulated scoring — matches `01_monitor`. |
# MAGIC | `z_critical` | `3.0` | Z-score threshold applied during simulated scoring — matches `01_monitor`. |
# MAGIC | `backtest_lookback_days` | `90` | How far back in `system.billing.usage` to replay. Wider window = more cases, longer runtime. |
# MAGIC | `baseline_lookback_days` | `30` | Size of the rolling baseline window used when scoring each simulated day — must match `00_baseline_refresh` for an apples-to-apples replay. |
