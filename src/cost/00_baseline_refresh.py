# Databricks notebook source

# MAGIC # 00_baseline_refresh
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Notebook Summary:** Builds the reference data `01_monitor` needs to score live clusters
# MAGIC - Current DBU/hr per node type (from the public pricing JSON)
# MAGIC - The customer's contracted `$/DBU` (from `system.billing.account_prices`)
# MAGIC - This workspace's historical `$/cluster` distribution used to detect statistical outliers.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Parameters
# MAGIC
# MAGIC | Widget | Default | What it controls |
# MAGIC |---|---|---|
# MAGIC | `catalog` | `main` | Catalog where all tables and views live. Auto-created if missing. |
# MAGIC | `schema` | `finops_observability` | Schema under `catalog`. Auto-created if missing. |
# MAGIC | `baseline_lookback_days` | `30` | Window of history from `system.billing.usage` used to calculate the workspace's historical $/cluster statistics (mean, stddev, percentiles) for outlier analysis. |
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This job produces five outputs:
# MAGIC 1. `pricing_rates` — flattened all-purpose pricing snapshot from the public pricing JSON, with `$/DBU` overridden to the SKU this workspace bills against.
# MAGIC 2. `workspace_baseline` — per-day stats of daily `$/cluster` for classic all-purpose in this workspace over the lookback window.
# MAGIC 3. `cluster_scores` — each all-purpose cluster's distance from the daily `$/cluster` mean
# MAGIC 4. `event_log` — append-only audit of routing events across every detector silo; backs per-(cluster, severity) suppression for the cost router via the `detector_name='cluster_cost'` filter.
# MAGIC 5. `cluster_alerts_latest` — the clusters that were flagged as outliers for review
