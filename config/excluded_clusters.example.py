"""
Clusters excluded from baseline statistics AND alert scoring.

Edit the lists below to filter out known-valid large clusters that would either
skew the workspace distribution (inflating mean/stddev so smaller outliers stop
being flagged) or generate noise alerts (e.g. always-on production ETL).

Three filter types — matching any single rule excludes the cluster from
baseline, monitor, and backtest. Excluded clusters in the live monitor still
get a row written to `cluster_scores` with signal='EXCLUDED' and the matching
rule named in `reason`, so the exclusion is auditable rather than silent.
